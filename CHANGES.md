# CHANGELOG

## 0.7.0 (???)

### Improvements

-   Support writing dataframes without geometry column (#267).
-   Calculate feature count by iterating over features if GDAL returns an
    unknown count for a data layer (e.g., OSM driver); this may have signficant
    performance impacts for some data sources that would otherwise return an
    unknown count (count is used in `read_info`, `read`, `read_dataframe`) (#271).
-   Add `arrow_to_pandas_kwargs` parameter to `read_dataframe` + reduce memory usage
    with `use_arrow=True` (#273)
-   In `read_info`, the result now also contains the `total_bounds` of the layer as well
    as some extra `capabilities` of the data source driver (#281).
-   Raise error if `read` or `read_dataframe` is called with parameters to read no
    columns, geometry, or fids (#280).
-   Automatically detect supported driver by extension for all available
    write drivers and addition of `detect_write_driver` (#270).
-   Addition of `mask` parameter to `open_arrow`, `read`, `read_dataframe`,
    and `read_bounds` functions to select only the features in the dataset that
    intersect the mask geometry (#285). Note: GDAL < 3.8.0 returns features that
    intersect the bounding box of the mask when using the Arrow interface for
    some drivers; this has been fixed in GDAL 3.8.0.
-   Removed warning when no features are read from the data source (#299).

### Other changes

-   test suite requires Shapely >= 2.0

-   using `skip_features` greater than the number of features available in a data
    layer now returns empty arrays for `read` and an empty DataFrame for
    `read_dataframe` instead of raising a `ValueError` (#282).
-   enabled `skip_features` and `max_features` for `read_arrow` and
    `read_dataframe(path, use_arrow=True)`. Note that this incurs overhead
    because all features up to the next batch size above `max_features` (or size
    of data layer) will be read prior to slicing out the requested range of
    features (#282).
-   The `use_arrow=True` option can be enabled globally for testing using the
    `PYOGRIO_USE_ARROW=1` environment variable (#296).

### Bug fixes

-   Fix int32 overflow when reading int64 columns (#260)
-   Fix `fid_as_index=True` doesn't set fid as index using `read_dataframe` with
    `use_arrow=True` (#265)
-   Fix errors reading OSM data due to invalid feature count and incorrect
    reading of OSM layers beyond the first layer (#271)
-   Always raise an exception if there is an error when writing a data source
    (#284)

### Potentially breaking changes

-   In `read_info` (#281):
    -   the `features` property in the result will now be -1 if calculating the
        feature count is an expensive operation for this driver. You can force it to be
        calculated using the `force_feature_count` parameter.
    -   for boolean values in the `capabilities` property, the values will now be
        booleans instead of 1 or 0.

### Packaging

-   The GDAL library included in the wheels is updated from 3.6.4 to GDAL 3.7.2.

## 0.6.0 (2023-04-27)

### Improvements

-   Add automatic detection of 3D geometries in `write_dataframe` (#223, #229)
-   Add "driver" property to `read_info` result (#224)
-   Add support for dataset open options to `read`, `read_dataframe`, and
    `read_info` (#233)
-   Add support for pandas' nullable data types in `write_dataframe`, or
    specifying a mask manually for missing values in `write` (#219)
-   Standardized 3-dimensional geometry type labels from "2.5D <type>" to
    "<type> Z" for consistency with well-known text (WKT) formats (#234)
-   Failure error messages from GDAL are no longer printed to stderr (they were
    already translated into Python exceptions as well) (#236).
-   Failure and warning error messages from GDAL are no longer printed to
    stderr: failures were already translated into Python exceptions
    and warning messages are now translated into Python warnings (#236, #242).
-   Add access to low-level pyarrow `RecordBatchReader` via
    `pyogrio.raw.open_arrow`, which allows iterating over batches of Arrow
    tables (#205).
-   Add support for writing dataset and layer metadata (where supported by
    driver) to `write` and `write_dataframe`, and add support for reading
    dataset and layer metadata in `read_info` (#237).

### Packaging

-   The GDAL library included in the wheels is updated from 3.6.2 to GDAL 3.6.4.
-   Wheels are now available for Linux aarch64 / arm64.

## 0.5.1 (2023-01-26)

### Bug fixes

-   Fix memory leak in reading files (#207)
-   Fix to only use transactions for writing records when supported by the
    driver (#203)

## 0.5.0 (2023-01-16)

### Major enhancements

-   Support for reading based on Arrow as the transfer mechanism of the data
    from GDAL to Python (requires GDAL >= 3.6 and `pyarrow` to be installed).
    This can be enabled by passing `use_arrow=True` to `pyogrio.read_dataframe`
    (or by using `pyogrio.raw.read_arrow` directly), and provides a further
    speed-up (#155, #191).
-   Support for appending to an existing data source when supported by GDAL by
    passing `append=True` to `pyogrio.write_dataframe` (#197).

### Potentially breaking changes

-   In floating point columns, NaN values are now by default written as "null"
    instead of NaN, but with an option to control this (pass `nan_as_null=False`
    to keep the previous behaviour) (#190).

### Improvements

-   It is now possible to pass GDAL's dataset creation options in addition
    to layer creation options in `pyogrio.write_dataframe` (#189).
-   When specifying a subset of `columns` to read, unnecessary IO or parsing
    is now avoided (#195).

### Packaging

-   The GDAL library included in the wheels is updated from 3.4 to GDAL 3.6.2,
    and is now built with GEOS and sqlite with rtree support enabled
    (which allows writing a spatial index for GeoPackage).
-   Wheels are now available for Python 3.11.
-   Wheels are now available for MacOS arm64.

## 0.4.2 (2022-10-06)

### Improvements

-   new `get_gdal_data_path()` utility funtion to check the path of the data
    directory detected by GDAL (#160)

### Bug fixes

-   register GDAL drivers during initial import of pyogrio (#145)
-   support writing "not a time" (NaT) values in a datetime column (#146)
-   fixes an error when reading GPKG with bbox filter (#150)
-   properly raises error when invalid where clause is used on a GPKG (#150)
-   avoid duplicate count of available features (#151)

## 0.4.1 (2022-07-25)

### Bug fixes

-   use user-provided `encoding` when reading files instead of using default
    encoding of data source type (#139)
-   always convert curve or surface geometry types to linear geometry types,
    such as lines or polygons (#140)

## 0.4.0 (2022-06-20)

### Major enhancements

-   support for reading from file-like objects and in-memory buffers (#25)
-   index of GeoDataFrame created by `read_dataframe` can now optionally be set
    to the FID of the features that are read, as `int64` dtype. Note that some
    drivers start FID numbering at 0 whereas others start numbering at 1.
-   generalize check for VSI files from `/vsizip` to `/vsi` (#29)
-   add dtype for each field to `read_info` (#30)
-   support writing empty GeoDataFrames (#38)
-   support URI schemes (`zip://`, `s3://`) (#43)
-   add keyword to promote mixed singular/multi geometry column to multi geometry type (#56)
-   Python wheels built for Windows, MacOS (x86_64), and Linux (x86_64) (#49, #55, #57, #61, #63)
-   automatically prefix zip files with URI scheme (#68)
-   support use of a sql statement in read_dataframe (#70)
-   correctly write geometry type for layer when dataset has multiple geometry types (#82)
-   support reading `bool`, `int16`, `float32` into correct dtypes (#83)
-   add `geometry_type` to `write_dataframe` to set geometry type for layer (#85)
-   Use certifi to set `GDAL_CURL_CA_BUNDLE` / `PROJ_CURL_CA_BUNDLE` defaults (#97)
-   automatically detect driver for `.geojson`, `.geojsonl` and `.geojsons` files (#101)
-   read DateTime fields with millisecond accuracy (#111)
-   support writing object columns with np.nan values (#118)
-   add support to write object columns that contain types different than string (#125)
-   support writing datetime columns (#120)
-   support for writing missing (null) geometries (#59)

### Breaking changes

-   `read` now also returns an optional FIDs ndarray in addition to meta,
    geometries, and fields; this is the 2nd item in the returned tuple.

### Potentially breaking changes

-   Consolidated error handling to better use GDAL error messages and specific
    exception classes (#39). Note that this is a breaking change only if you are
    relying on specific error classes to be emitted.
-   by default, writing GeoDataFrames with mixed singular and multi geometry
    types will automatically promote to the multi type if the driver does not
    support mixed geometry types (e.g., `FGB`, though it can write mixed geometry
    types if `geometry_type` is set to `"Unknown"`)
-   the geometry type of datasets with multiple geometry types will be set to
    `"Unknown"` unless overridden using `geometry_type`. Note:
    `"Unknown"` may be ignored by some drivers (e.g., shapefile)

### Bug fixes

-   use dtype `object` instead of `numpy.object` to eliminate deprecation warnings (#34)
-   raise error if layer cannot be opened (#35)
-   fix passing gdal creation parameters in `write_dataframe` (#62)
-   fix passing kwargs to GDAL in `write_dataframe` (#67)

### Changes from 0.4.0a1

-   `layer_geometry_type` introduced in 0.4.0a1 was renamed to `geometry_type` for consistency
