# CHANGELOG

## 0.6.0 (???)

### Improvements

- ENH: add "driver" property to read_info result (#224)

## 0.5.1 (2023-01-26)

### Bug fixes

-   Fix memory leak in reading files (#207)
-   Fix to only use transactions for writing records when supported by the
    driver (#203)

## 0.5.0 (2023-01-16)

### Major enhancements

-   Support for reading based on Arrow as the transfer mechanism of the data
    from GDAL to Python (requires GDAL >= 3.6 and `pyarrow` to be installed).
    This can be enabled by passing `use_arrow=True` to `pyogrio.read_dataframe`
    (or by using `pyogrio.raw.read_arrow` directly), and provides a further
    speed-up (#155, #191).
-   Support for appending to an existing data source when supported by GDAL by
    passing `append=True` to `pyogrio.write_dataframe` (#197).

### Potentially breaking changes

-   In floating point columns, NaN values are now by default written as "null"
    instead of NaN, but with an option to control this (pass `nan_as_null=False`
    to keep the previous behaviour) (#190).

### Improvements

-   It is now possible to pass GDAL's dataset creation options in addition
    to layer creation options in `pyogrio.write_dataframe` (#189).
-   When specifying a subset of `columns` to read, unnecessary IO or parsing
    is now avoided (#195).

### Packaging

-   The GDAL library included in the wheels is updated from 3.4 to GDAL 3.6.2,
    and is now built with GEOS and sqlite with rtree support enabled
    (which allows writing a spatial index for GeoPackage).
-   Wheels are now available for Python 3.11.
-   Wheels are now available for MacOS arm64.

## 0.4.2 (2022-10-06)

### Improvements

-   new `get_gdal_data_path()` utility funtion to check the path of the data
    directory detected by GDAL (#160)

### Bug fixes

-   register GDAL drivers during initial import of pyogrio (#145)
-   support writing "not a time" (NaT) values in a datetime column (#146)
-   fixes an error when reading GPKG with bbox filter (#150)
-   properly raises error when invalid where clause is used on a GPKG (#150)
-   avoid duplicate count of available features (#151)

## 0.4.1 (2022-07-25)

### Bug fixes

-   use user-provided `encoding` when reading files instead of using default
    encoding of data source type (#139)
-   always convert curve or surface geometry types to linear geometry types,
    such as lines or polygons (#140)

## 0.4.0 (2022-06-20)

### Major enhancements

-   support for reading from file-like objects and in-memory buffers (#25)
-   index of GeoDataFrame created by `read_dataframe` can now optionally be set
    to the FID of the features that are read, as `int64` dtype. Note that some
    drivers start FID numbering at 0 whereas others start numbering at 1.
-   generalize check for VSI files from `/vsizip` to `/vsi` (#29)
-   add dtype for each field to `read_info` (#30)
-   support writing empty GeoDataFrames (#38)
-   support URI schemes (`zip://`, `s3://`) (#43)
-   add keyword to promote mixed singular/multi geometry column to multi geometry type (#56)
-   Python wheels built for Windows, MacOS (x86_64), and Linux (x86_64) (#49, #55, #57, #61, #63)
-   automatically prefix zip files with URI scheme (#68)
-   support use of a sql statement in read_dataframe (#70)
-   correctly write geometry type for layer when dataset has multiple geometry types (#82)
-   support reading `bool`, `int16`, `float32` into correct dtypes (#83)
-   add `geometry_type` to `write_dataframe` to set geometry type for layer (#85)
-   Use certifi to set `GDAL_CURL_CA_BUNDLE` / `PROJ_CURL_CA_BUNDLE` defaults (#97)
-   automatically detect driver for `.geojson`, `.geojsonl` and `.geojsons` files (#101)
-   read DateTime fields with millisecond accuracy (#111)
-   support writing object columns with np.nan values (#118)
-   add support to write object columns that contain types different than string (#125)
-   support writing datetime columns (#120)
-   support for writing missing (null) geometries (#59)

### Breaking changes

-   `read` now also returns an optional FIDs ndarray in addition to meta,
    geometries, and fields; this is the 2nd item in the returned tuple.

### Potentially breaking changes

-   Consolidated error handling to better use GDAL error messages and specific
    exception classes (#39). Note that this is a breaking change only if you are
    relying on specific error classes to be emitted.
-   by default, writing GeoDataFrames with mixed singular and multi geometry
    types will automatically promote to the multi type if the driver does not
    support mixed geometry types (e.g., `FGB`, though it can write mixed geometry
    types if `geometry_type` is set to `"Unknown"`)
-   the geometry type of datasets with multiple geometry types will be set to
    `"Unknown"` unless overridden using `geometry_type`. Note:
    `"Unknown"` may be ignored by some drivers (e.g., shapefile)

### Bug fixes

-   use dtype `object` instead of `numpy.object` to eliminate deprecation warnings (#34)
-   raise error if layer cannot be opened (#35)
-   fix passing gdal creation parameters in `write_dataframe` (#62)
-   fix passing kwargs to GDAL in `write_dataframe` (#67)

### Changes from 0.4.0a1

-   `layer_geometry_type` introduced in 0.4.0a1 was renamed to `geometry_type` for consistency

## 0.3.0 (2021-12-22)

### Major enhancements

-   Auto-discovery of `GDAL_VERSION` on Windows, if `gdalinfo.exe` is discoverable
    on the `PATH`.
-   Addition of `read_bounds` function to read the bounds of each feature.
-   Addition of a `fids` keyword to `read` and `read_dataframe` to selectively
    read features based on a list of the FIDs.

## 0.2.0 (2021-04-02)

### Major enhancements

-   initial support for building on Windows.
-   Windows: enabled search for GDAL dll directory for Python >= 3.8.
-   Addition of `where` parameter to `read` and `read_dataframe` to enable GDAL-compatible
    SQL WHERE queries to filter data sources.
-   Addition of `force_2d` parameter to `read` and `read_dataframe` to force
    coordinates to always be returned as 2 dimensional, dropping the 3rd dimension
    if present.
-   Addition of `bbox` parameter to `read` and `read_dataframe` to select only
    the features in the dataset that intersect the bbox.
-   Addition of `set_gdal_config_options` to set GDAL configuration options and
    `get_gdal_config_option` to get a GDAL configuration option.
-   Addition of `pyogrio.__gdal_version__` attribute to return GDAL version tuple
    and `__gdal_version_string__` to return string version.
-   Addition of `list_drivers` function to list all available GDAL drivers.
-   Addition of read and write support for `FlatGeobuf` driver when available in GDAL.

## 0.1.0 (2020-08-28)

### Major enhancements

-   Addition of `list_layers` to list layers in a data source.
-   Addition of `read_info` to read basic information for a layer.
-   Addition of `read_dataframe` to read from supported file formats (Shapefile, GeoPackage, GeoJSON) into GeoDataFrames.
-   Addition of `write_dataframe` to write GeoDataFrames into supported file formats.
