# pyogrio - Vectorized spatial vector file format I/O using GDAL/OGR

Pyogrio provides a
[GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas)-oriented API to OGR vector
data sources, such as ESRI Shapefile, GeoPackage, and GeoJSON. This converts to
/ from `GeoPandas` `GeoDataFrame`s when the data source includes geometry and `Pandas`
`DataFrame`s otherwise.


```{warning}
This is an early version and the API is subject to substantial change.
```
